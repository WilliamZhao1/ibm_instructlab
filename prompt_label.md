This is the guideline on how to label questions as either Global or Local based on a knowledge graph database. To maximize labelling accuracy, pay close attention to the following aspects of the question: 

Scope: 
Global: The question requires an analysis or understanding of the entire knowledge graph or a large portion of it. It typically involves aggregations, patterns, or themes that span multiple entities and relationships. 
Example: "What are the top five themes in this dataset?" 
Local: The question centers on specific entities or a small, well-defined subset of the knowledge graph, focusing on detailed information about those entities. 
Example: "What are the healing properties of chamomile?" 

Complexity: 
Global: The question is broad and may require complex queries or analyses that aggregate data across numerous nodes and edges in the graph. 
Local: The question is usually specific and can be answered by querying a limited number of nodes and edges. 

Data Requirements: 
Global: Requires data that is distributed across various parts of the knowledge graph. The answer depends on a comprehensive view and often involves synthesizing information from diverse areas. 
Local: Requires data from a specific part or small section of the knowledge graph. The answer typically involves focused information related to particular entities. 

Context Dependence: 
Global: Context is derived broadly from the interconnected nature of multiple entities and relationships throughout the knowledge graph. 
Local: Context is narrowly defined and directly associated with particular entities or a small group of related entities. 

Nature of Relationships: 
Global: Often involves multiple types of relationships and their interconnections across the knowledge graph to derive insight. 
Local: Mostly involves direct relationships related to specific entities. 

Examples and Semantic Meaning: 
Global: Questions that require an understanding of overall patterns or insights: 
Example: "What are the patterns of collaboration among researchers in this dataset?" 
Local: Questions that focus on specific entities or direct relationships within the knowledge graph: 
Example: "Which papers did Dr. Smith co-author?" 

By considering these aspects, ensure that your categorization is accurate and contextually appropriate.
